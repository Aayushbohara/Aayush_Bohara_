      <h2><span>My Web Development Journey </span></h2> 
      <p>Learning web development basics was tough for me. Coding and design concepts were confusing at first. But slowly, I started getting the hang of things & my skills improved. Fixing bugs was super hard, but practice made me better at spotting & fixing problems. My journey had its ups and downs but it felt good seeing my improvement.</p>

      <h2><span>Looking Back on My Journey </span></h2> 
      <p>During the course, I learned a lot about web development & design. HTML, CSS, and user interface design principles were no longer mysteries to me. This course pushed me to think critically and creatively, and I loved using what I learned to make cool websites.</p>

    <div> 
      <h2><span>Building the Website </span></h2> 
      <p>Over time, I worked on developing my own site, focusing on both tech and design stuff. For the design, I went for a sleek modern look with simple colors like purple as the main color, some purplish black background, and white text. Google Fonts helped me pick a font that looked good across devices and was easy to read. Getting inspired by other websites, I borrowed some design elements too.</p>
      <p>On the tech side, I made sure my site looked good on different screens by using media queries & flexbox for easy navigation. Organizing HTML and CSS code neatly with comments made it user-friendly & readable.</p>
      <p>I'm happy and proud of how far my website has come and excited to keep growing my web skills in development and design!</p>
